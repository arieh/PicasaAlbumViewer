PicacaAlbumViewer v1.1
========================
This package is made out of 2 parts which can be used seperatly:
1. a PHP Class intended for extracting a Picasa Album's image information
2. a Mootools class to create a Thumbnail list out of a UL of images (for now all LIs must be of the same size).
* the demo uses the smoothbox Mootools library to create the Litebox effect

the two can obviously be used seperatly, but the ThumbSlides class must be used with a fixed LI width to function properly, 
and comes with a collection of css files to match some of Google's thumbnail sizes (34,64,72). it's recomended to use the croped version of the images 
for best design.

Google Album ID
=================
as of 1.1, the album viewer uses the rss of the album to retrieve the messages.
