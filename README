PicacaAlbumViewer v1.1
========================
This package is made out of 2 parts which can be used seperatly:
1. a PHP Class intended for extracting a Picasa Album's image information
2. a Mootools class to create a Thumbnail list out of a UL of images (for now all LIs must be of the same size).
* the demo uses the smoothbox Mootools library to create the Litebox effect

the two can obviously be used seperatly, but the ThumbSlides class must be used with a fixed LI width to function properly, 
and comes with a collection of css files to match some of Google's thumbnail sizes (34,64,72). it's recomended to use the croped version of the images 
for best design.

Google Album ID
=================
as of 1.1, the album viewer uses the rss of the album to retrieve the messages.

About Thumbslides JS:
======================
the class is very dependant on class names. specifically, in order to save resources, the class expects
list items will have an assigned class holding their dimentions you can change the class name with itemClass, 
or choose not to use ths feature with the useItemClass flag (NOTE - this will be very expensive - as it will clone the entire list).
the other class which requiers strict definitions is the subcontainer class, and specificaly its width. 

you can expirement with the CSS files to check what is tweakable and what is not
